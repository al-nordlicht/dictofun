# TODO

* implement baisc pairing (both sides)

* fix hardware errors (separate button-LED control, separate LDO control from MCU, PDM microphone, RS trigger for power control (?) )

* add HW features (battery level measurement, maybe - some sort of charger for the battery)

* make Android app work in the background

* (consider) make an iOS app

* rework SPI flash access to enable 256 bytes access

* tune advertising (on the device) and activity periods (on the android app)

* add STL models for the case
