Rework for v1.1.
* cut lines that are coming to pins p0.25 and p0.26 and put a ~1k resistor into the cut. If this is not done, NRF52 burns down.

TODO for v1.1:
* investigate why LDO is not shutdown after it is pulled down.

For newer versionss
* add current limiting resistors on lines MAIN_BUTTON and DBG_POWER_LATCH that enter the microcontroller. 
* use teardrops for the pins
* enforce the testpoints and b- / b+ points (with vias and/or with thicker lines/more vias)
* consider a debug plug that wouldn't require soldering a 10-pin JTAG connector for flashing.
